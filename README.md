# memory-game
its a matching card game
* At first you have to turn over any card randomly to know the symbol underlying it.
* Now in order to find out the corresponding card with the same symbol,turn over any other card.
* Both the cards will stay flipped over, if it holds the same symbol.
* Otherwise both of them are made to turn over to face down.
* You will win the game, once you have correctly matched all the cards with less time.

***Enjoy the game***
